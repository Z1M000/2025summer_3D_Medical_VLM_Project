2025 Summer Research: 3D Medical VLM Project

This repository contains scripts for converting the CT-RATE dataset into the M3D dataset format for 20000 samples, including report text, VQA (Visual Question Answering) items, and 3D model preprocessing.

The workflow automates downloading, conversion, and uploading data for use in 3D Medical Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
